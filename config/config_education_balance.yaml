# Agent Decision Principles

  - "Consider your children's educational needs, family financial situation, and commute distance when making school choices."
  - "Evaluate the trade-offs between school quality, housing costs, and daily convenience."
  - "Think about long-term educational outcomes versus immediate practical considerations."
